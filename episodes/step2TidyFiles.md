Build your knowledge trust when sharing with collaborators or publication with well organized datasets. This also saves time in data cleaning, and ensures analysis pipelines are robust.


### How to structure Column Data

Tidy data developed by Hadley Wickham offer a set of rules to record, organise, and maintain data to ensure your analysis is effective, reproducible, and manageable.

The principles of tidy data provide a standard way to organize data values within a dataset.

Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data:

Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.

Each observation is a row; each row is an observation.

Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.
