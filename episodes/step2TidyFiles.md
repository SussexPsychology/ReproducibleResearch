# Step 2 - Keeping your files Tidy and Organized


Build your knowledge trust when sharing with collaborators or publication with well organized datasets. This also saves time in data cleaning, and ensures analysis pipelines are robust.


### How to structure Column Data - Tidy data

Tidy data developed by Hadley Wickham offer a set of rules to record, organise, and maintain data to ensure your analysis is effective, reproducible, and manageable.

The principles of tidy data provide a standard way to organize data values within a dataset.

Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. 

The fundamental principles of tidy data are:
1. Each variable is a column
2. Each row is an observation
3. Each cell contains one value

Let's look at an example:

Each variable is in a separate column  i.e. the thing you’re measuring, like ‘age’ or ‘temperature’ or ‘height’. 
Each observation is in a separate row
Each cell contains one value (either a number or character string) 

Let's look at an example:
