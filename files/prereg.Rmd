On Thursday, June 5 Sussex will be providing a workshop on "Getting started with pre-registration and Registered Reports".

> Part of the Becoming an Open Researcher programme, this introductory workshop will clarify the differences between preregistration and Registered Reports, provide practical advice on using preregistration tools and explore effective implementation strategies. In addition, it provides a chance to meet with others who share the same commitment to fostering open research practices.
