Reproducibility is important to the future of research, and is all about working collaboratively, and openly with others. In this workshop we will introduce concepts and tools that researchers are developing and using which aim to make their research more reproducible – so that others can examine their processes, and build on top of findings more easily.

Our 7 steps for reproducible research:
1. Planning to be Organised
2. Keeping your files Tidy and Organised
3. Methodology and Protocols
4. Documentation and writing it down
5. Testing and Controls
6. Automation
7. Publishing, Persistent Identifiers and Preparing for Reuse

### Intended audience

This workshop is aimed at UGs, PGTs, and ECRs who are interested in learning more about open and reproducible research, and how it can make their work easier and stronger. No prior skills or knowledge are needed.


#### All disciplines welcome

This course intends to be discipline-neutral.


#### What to bring?
As an attendee, you won’t need to prepare anything for this workshop. It is suggested you have a notepad or document open for activities.
There won’t be datasets or programs needed for these lessons.


#### All skill levels welcome

This course is not aimed at taking you to 100% in Reproducible Research - instead it aims to introduce you to reproducible research techniques that can aid your projects, and provide good
practices that will benefit you as a future researcher. You should be able to finish this workshop with a few new ideas and skills to start on easy changes.
