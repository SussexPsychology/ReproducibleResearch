If you have spare time, you may want to share the 'culture' page that's in the instructor menu. Consider your audience - this may be less relevant to an audience of students and ECR's, however your more senior academics and leaders may find the content thought-provoking.

## Where to from here?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

A place to share what is happening at your own institutes, and where attendees can get support.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


<!-- Does your institute have a Reproducibility club, ReproducibiliTea group or webpages on reproducibility? This is where to include it. Also add any further follow up information you would like to share.

This information will be visible here: https://amandamiotto.github.io/ReproducibleResearch/instructor/wrapup.html#where-to-from-here

If you could pick one thing to do differently in your research right now, what would it be?
What tools and ideas are most relevent to you? Which ideas _don't_ feel relevent to you right now?
For some of our 7 lessons, do we have some action points that ideally we would do?

***Take this time to do one of the following:***

Email yourself a website you've found today to read through later.

Set a calendar entry to dedicate some time to complete a task.

Pair with someone here to encourage each other.
